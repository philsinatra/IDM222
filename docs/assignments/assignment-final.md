# IDM222 Final Project

This page describes an assignment for this course. Due dates and submissions are handled through [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/).

## Final Project

The final project is a fully functioning, fluid, responsive website, built with HTML and CSS. JavaScript enhancements are okay, as long as they are all functioning properly and used as progressive enhancement. The primary focus should be HTML structure and CSS.

Your final project represents the culmination of past ten weeks.  This project will be graded based on the following criteria:

1. Code Quality
    - Is all of your code valid?
    - Did you follow best practices regarding file names, characters, coding styles?
    - Is your code legible and easy to navigate?
    - Does your code use comments?
1. Functionality
    - Everything needs to work (e.g. links, videos, audio, images, rollovers etc.). If it's part of your site it must be working properly.
1. Design
    - Is your site visually pleasing?
    - Is your content legible with proper contrast, color scheme, typography etc.?
    - Would you feel comfortable using this project in a job interview as an example of your skills?

## Submitting the Assignment

Submit the following items in [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/) under **Final Project**:

1. A link to your self hosted website project page. From this page, I can fully engage the project and have access to all supplementary pages and functions.
2. A link to your GitHub repository containing the code for your final project. Remember: a well maintained repository does not include binary files, but these files are essential to your project. Host the files on your server and use documentation within your project to include references and links for downloads of critical binary files. Your repository **must** follow the following naming convention: _idm222-xxx123_ where _xxx123_ is your student ID shorthand.

**Late submissions receive zero points.**
